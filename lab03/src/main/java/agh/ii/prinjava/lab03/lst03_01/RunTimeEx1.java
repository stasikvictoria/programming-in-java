/**
 * {@code RuntimeException} is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown
 * during the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine.
 *
 * <p>{@code RuntimeException} and its subclasses are unchecked exceptions.
 * Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in a method or constructor's throws clause
 * if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate
 * outside the method or constructor boundary.
 *
 * <p>Runtime exceptions can occur anywhere in a program, and in a typical one they can be very numerous.
 * Having to add runtime exceptions in every method declaration would reduce a program's clarity.
 * Thus, the compiler does not require that you catch or specify runtime exceptions (although you can).
 *
 * <p>One case where it is a common practice to throw a RuntimeException is when the user calls a method
 * incorrectly. For example, a method can check if one of its arguments is incorrectly null.
 * If an argument is null, the method might throw a NullPointerException, which is an unchecked exception.
 *
 * <p>Generally speaking, do not throw a RuntimeException or create a subclass of RuntimeException
 * simply because you don't want to be bothered with specifying the exceptions your methods can throw.
 *
 * <p>Here's the bottom line guideline: If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception,
 * make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception,
 * make it an unchecked exception.
