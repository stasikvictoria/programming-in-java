// Examples of user-defined exceptions/errors

/**
 * An {@code Error} is a subclass of {@code Throwable} that indicates serious problems that a reasonable
 * application should not try to catch.
 *
 * <p>The class Error is a separate subclass of {@code Throwable}, distinct from {@code Exception} in the class
 * hierarchy, to allow programs to use the idiom "} catch (Exception e) {" to catch all exceptions from which
 * recovery may be possible without catching errors from which recovery is typically not possible.
 *
 * <p>Note: A method is NOT required to declare in its {@code throws} clause any subclasses of {@code Error}
 * that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught, since these errors are abnormal
 * conditions that should never occur. That is, {@code Error} and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked
 * exceptions for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions.
 *
